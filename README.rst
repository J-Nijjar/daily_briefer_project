Daily Briefer
=============

**Daily Briefer** is a project that aims to create an efficient method for 
providing users with a scheduled reminder of a "collection" of information
that they deem important. It's purpose is to increase productivity by reducing
the amount of time spent switching through applications to find information.

For example, take a professional worker who commutes to the city from the
suburbs during the week. His morning routine consists of checking google maps
for potential traffic disruptions, the weather, the timing of his scheduled
meetings, and that it's his wedding aniversary tommorow. Typically, this
involves him switching through different apps, and being distracted by a
plethora of other "noisy" information that isn't necessary to him. The
daily briefer aims to mitigate that by providing a clear and concise
notification of all information that he requires to successfully start his
day.
